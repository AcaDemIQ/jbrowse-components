We are pleased to present the release of v1.7.5

This release includes two major improvements

- Ability to index tracks for searching by gene names in JBrowse Desktop. This
  let's users choose per-track indexes in the add track widget interactively,
  or index them after-the-fact using the track menu.
- Removed serialization of BAM/CRAM features for pileup tracks which brings
  large performance benefits for jbrowse-web and jbrowse-desktop. The main
  thread has to manually request any data it needs from the worker after
  rendering (e.g. when we click a feature), and not assume the feature data is
  available on the main thread

Figure showing performance improvement of the noserialize improvement compared
with v1.7.4, which brings the webworker performance in line with the embedded
app (which does no serialzation)

This release also fixes a bug with using trix indexes created by `jbrowse text-index` in v1.7.0-v1.7.4 (with the adjustable prefix size)
