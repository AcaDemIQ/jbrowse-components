We're excited to announce the v1.4.0 release of JBrowse Web! Some highlights of
this release include:

## Text Searching

Text searching is now available in JBrowse2!

JBrowse Web users will now be able to create their own text indexes with the `jbrowse text-index` command and use them to search for names or identifiers via the location search box of the Linear Genome View.

## New jbrowse-desktop start screen design

Another update in this release is our new and redesigned start screen for a new version of our public beta JBrowse desktop. The new design now shows a view launcher option when there are no views open, offers preconfigured datasets, and adds the ability to open a new assembly directly from the start screen.
