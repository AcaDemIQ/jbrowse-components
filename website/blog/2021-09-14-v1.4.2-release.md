We're excited to announce the v1.4.2 release! Some highlights of this release
include:

## Text searching

Finally, we have added the ability to search by gene name!

Users will now be able to create their own text indexes with the `jbrowse text-index` command, which creates an index for searching by gene names, identifiers and descriptions.

For a quick introduction and a tutorial on how to add this feature to your JBrowse instance, check out this [quick start](/docs/quickstart_cli#indexing-feature-names-for-searching)

Like most parts of JBrowse, the text searching system is pluggable. Plugin developers can add new text index adapters to connect JBrowse to other types of text search services, indexes, or databases.

Users of the @jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view can also enable text searching functionality, see https://jbrowse.org/storybook/lgv/v1.4.0/?path=/story/text-searching--page
