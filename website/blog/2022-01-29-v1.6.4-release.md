title: v1.6.4 Release

This release has a couple long awaited features!

- Ability to load a session from a URL in JBrowse Web, for example,
  https://jbrowse.org/code/jb2/v1.6.0/?config=test_data/volvox/config.json&loc=ctgA:2000-40000&assembly=volvox&tracks=gff3tabix_genes,volvox_filtered_vcf,volvox_microarray,volvox_cram
  (note: the embedded components do not make any assumptions about the URL, so
  do not have this functionality. Just the JBrowse Web package)
- Stats estimation, tracks will try to estimate how much data they have to load
  and hide themselves if it is determined to be too much

There are also some improvements to synteny and dotplot views. The synteny view
can now render curvy lines and "square" the views (so they each have the same
zoom level), and have individual search panels in the synteny view. You can now
also vertically resize the linear synteny view panel allowing for a taller or
shorter view! The rendering has also been sped up in both linear synteny and
dotplot views with certain code paths being up to 40x faster
